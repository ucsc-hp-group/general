HP Group - OSMS API
End date: February 7
Sprint 1 Plan

Goal:
    Learn the swift implementation, and how we can put our API into it.
    Make general design decisions for the rest of the project.
    
User Stories/Tasks
    Story1: As a dev I want to fork the swift project, and set up our
    dedicated machines in the lab.
    
        -Task1: Fork swift project (1 hr)
        -Task2: Set Up dev machines in lab. (4 hr)
    
    Story2: As a dev I want to study swift so I can understand how the
    relevant implementation works.
    
        -Task1: Each person work on learning the existing API calls
                for adding objects and using HTTP requests/headers
                to interface with Swift. (3 hr/person = 21)
        -Task2: Read through relevant source code for Swift. (4 hr/person = 28)
    
    Story3: As a dev I want to choose between the implementation methods
    proposed by the original author of the API (internal/external)
    
        -Task1: As a team meet/talk with Sam and/or Lincoln
                to talk technical specifics (4hr) (technically per person, but in class time)
        -Task2: As a team plan and make design decisions. (1 hr/person)
    
    Story4: As a user I want to be able to put the API version header in
    and API call.
    
        -Task1: Be able to receive API version number. (2 hr)
    
    Story5: As a user I want an implementation of a basic API call (\get)
    to show I can access the metadata and http header info
    
        -Task1: Implement the basic structure for receiving API calls as HTTP request. (2hr/person)
