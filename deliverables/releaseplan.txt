High level goals:
    Implement the Object Storage Metadata Search (OSMS) API 
    to the OpenStack Swift architecture
    
Sprint 1:
    
    As a dev I want to fork the swift project, and set up our
    dedicated machines in the lab. (13)
    
    As a dev I want to study swift so I can understand how the
    relevant implementation works. (21)
    
    As a dev I want to choose between the implementation methods
    proposed by the original author of the API (internal/external) (13)
    
    As a user I want to be able to put the API version header in
    and API call. (3)
    
    As a user I want an implementation of a basic API call (\get)
    to show I can access the metadata and http header info (8)
    
Sprint 2:
    
    As a user I want an implementation of the method chosen in
    Sprint 1. (34)
    
    As a user, I want to access the simplest API call to retrieve
    metadata. (13)
    
Sprint 3:
    
    As a user I want to be able to filter by attributes. (8)
    
    As a user I want to be able to add queries to the API call. (8)
