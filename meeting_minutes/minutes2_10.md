Swift Cluster Posse
===================

## 02/10/14 Meeting Minutes

HP called and we discussed our current plan for implementing the Swift metadata
server. Sam and Lincoln have approved of our plan, but have raised some
concerns with our choice of SQL server. We have been told that *SQLite* is a less
scalable solution than more sophisticated databases such as *MySQL*.

We have also decided that *mob programming* will be a good way to accelerate our
progress when it comes time to start the implementation workflow.
